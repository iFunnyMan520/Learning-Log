I will create a Learning Log web application that lets users keep a diary of topics of interest and create diary entries as they learn each topic. Learning Log Home Page contains a description of the site and invites the user to register or enter your credentials. After a successful login, the user will take the ability to create new topics, add new posts, read and edit existing entries.
